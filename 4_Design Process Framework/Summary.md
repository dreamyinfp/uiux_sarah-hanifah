(4) Design Process Framework

Summary of Design Thinking

Introductory

Design thinking is not an exclusive property of designers.

It is a universal framework for all blueprint creators (eg. people working on literature engineering, and business) because of how its scalability to systematically extract, teach, learn, and apply, these human-centered techniques to solve all their base problems.

Design Thinking: An Overview

Design Thinking: Definition
The design thinking framework is based on the philosophy that a hands-on, user-centric approach

The design thinking framework is based on the philosophy that a hands-on, user-centric approach to problem-solving promotes innovation; in turn, innovation can lead to differentiation and competitive advantage.

Design Thinking: Goals
The overall goal is to identify alternative strategies and solutions that are not instantly apparent with your initial level of understanding.

Process & Output

Design Thinking: Empathize (The Process)

Empathize
Conduct research in order to develop knowledge about what your users do, say, think, and feel.

The goal is to gather enough observations so that you can truly begin to empathize with your users and their perspectives.

Output: Conducted User Research

In this phase:

- You talk to a range of actual users.
- Directly observe what they do, how they think, and what they want, asking yourself things like 'what motivates or discourages users?' or 'where do they experience frustration?'

Design Thinking: Empathize (The Output)

User Research
In this stage, you would likely try to illuminate what you don't know and better understand what people need.

It's especially important to do discovery activities before making a new product or feature, so you can find out whether it makes sense to do the project at all.

Research to consider:

- Conduct field studies and interview users: Go where the users are, watch, ask, and listen. Observe people in context interacting with the system or solving the problems you're trying to provide solutions for.
- Run diary studies to understand your users' information needs and behaviors.

User Research: How to Conduct?

- Set a goal for the interview.
- Make the user feel as comfortable as possible. Create a rapport with the user.
- Prepare questions before the interview.
- Anticipate different responses, and construct follow-up questions based on your research goals.
- Write dialog-provoking interview questions.
- Avoid leading, closed, or vague questions.
- Prepare more questions than you believe you will have time to ask.
- Practice your go-to follow-up questions.

Design Thinking: Define (The Process)

Define
Combine all your research and observe where your users' problems exist.

The goal is to pinpoint your users' needs. You will begin to highlight opportunities for innovation.

Output: User Persona / User Journey

In this phase:

- Use the data gathered in the empathize phase to glean insights.
- Organize all your observations and draw parallels across your users' current experiences.
- Identify unmet user needs.

Design Thinking: Define (The Output)

User Persona Sample
There are many examples of how a user persona should look, most important thing to look out for is you have to figure out whether your persona has the ability to profile your overall user or not.

User Journey Sample
A journey map is a visualization of the process that a person goes through in order to accomplish a goal.

Most journey maps follow a similar format:

- at the top, a specific user, a specific scenario, and corresponding expectations or goals
- in the middle, high-level phases are comprised of user actions, thoughts, and emotions
- at the bottom, the takeaways: opportunities, insights, and internal ownership

Quick Tip: Depict Your User

- Use a map that depicts your customer/user journey
- Use illustrations and visuals to emphasize persona information
- Highlight common metrics and key differences
- Use sliding scales to define user characteristics
- Keep them short and sweet

Design Thinking: Ideate (The Process)

Ideate
Brainstorm a range of crazy, creative ideasthat address the unmet user needs identified in the define phase. Give yourself and your team total freedom; no idea is too farfetched and quantity supersedes quality.

The goal is to map user needs, and illustrates solution flow.

Output: Conceptual Model (Eg. User Flow,
Task Flow), Early Interface Stage

In this phase:

- At this phase, bring your team members together and sketch out many different ideas.
- Share ideas with one another, mixing and remixing, building on others' ideas.
- Brainstorm every solution map

A hardworking solo? Brainstorm with yourself! Sharpen your discovery skills!

Design Thinking: Ideate (The Output)

User Flow
User Flow is the path a user follows through an application.

The flow doesn't have to be linear, it can branch out in a non-linear path. By determining this path you can see possible turns through the route and can optimize the user experience.

Task Flow
Task flow is a single flow completed similarly by all users for a specific action. Ex. Sign Up. Task flows have a singular flow, they don't branch out.

Early Interface Stage: Wireframe (Low Fidelity)
Wireframes visualize a user path or flow, as well as page layouts, information hierarchy, and even interactions.

Depending on their purpose, they can vary in fidelity
from quick sketches to detailed representations of the final design.

Design Thinking: Prototype (The Process)

Prototype
Build real, tactile representations for a subset of your ideas.

The goal is to understand what components of your ideas work and which do not.

Output: High fidelity UI

In this phase:

- Modelling high fidelity interface
- Weight impact vs feasibility of your ideas
- Receive feedback on from your prototype

Design Thinking: Prototype (The Output)

User Interface: High Fidelity
In this phase you have crafted a high fidelity user interface.

- Visual Side:
  Graphics, spacing, and layout look like a live system would look
- Content & Navigation Property Side:
  All the content that would appear in the final design
- Interactivity Side:
  Many or all are clickable. It correspondent to each of the presented Ul design

Design Thinking: Test (The Process)

Test
Return to your users for feedback.
Ask yourself 'Does this solution meet users' needs?' and 'Has it improved how they feel, think, or do their tasks?'

Output: Synthesized Testing Result

In this phase:

- Put your prototype in front of real customers
- Verify that it achieves your goals.
- As you are executing your vision, continue to test along the way.

Design Thinking: Test (The Output)

Usability Testing
Practically a usability testing is a momentum where designer can evaluate their interface.

Here is a quick explanation on how to conduct

- a researcher (called a "facilitator" or a "moderator") asks a participant to perform tasks
- Usually using one or more specific user interfaces.
- While the participant completes each task, the researcher observes the participant's behavior and listens for feedback.

Design Thinking: Implement (The Process & Output)

Implement
Put the vision into effect. Ensure that your solution is materialized and touches the lives of your end users.

Output: Final Product

The Advantages

Numerous reasons to engage in design thinking, in summary, design thinking achieves all these advantages at the same time:

- It is a user-centered process that starts with user data, creates design artifacts that address real and not imaginary user needs, and then tests those artifacts with real users.
- It leverages collective expertise and establishes a shared language and buy-in amongst your team.
- It encourages innovation by exploring multiple avenues for the same problem.

Summary of Design Framework

Get to Know

What's with Thinking Process & Framework?
Same goes with how neurons connect with each other and creating a synapses between them, a thinking process will also help you connect between information

The moment you start connecting between information, your amazing brain is creating an initial framework by dividing which step should you have done first!

What does it have to do with UI/UX?
In order to craft a better user experience, an initial framework will be needed to start mapping a general problem, and extract solution layers.

Framework 101

How it should work?
Remember the lucky 7!

1. Determine the steps of creating designs.
2. Show a clear direction.
3. Make deliverables single-concept.
4. Help the design team reach a consensus.
5. Save designers' time and effort.
6. Minimize misunderstanding.
7. Finally, they work!

Usability Relevance
Once we complete mapping, you shouldn't forget about the core in creating a great user experience-by considering usability goals as your success metrics.

Importance of Framework

- They allow you to split the design process into baby steps.
- Great product accomplishments and advancement come from the results of implementing correct framework.
- Using frameworks may also evoke a new wave of creativity.

Understanding 5 Elements of UX Design
That neat, tidy experience actually results from a whole set of decisions (some small, some large) about how the site looks, how it behaves, and what it allows you to do. These decisions build upon each other, informing and influencing all aspects of the user experience.

Strategy, This is where you define the user's needs and business goals

Scope, This is where you define what you want to build. You decide on the features and content that the product should contain.

Structure. You figure out how to organize your design and how the user will interact with it.

Skeleton, which you can think of as the layout. Similar to how the layout of our bones shapes our skin, this layer helps detail how the design works, but just like our bones, the user will not see these inner workings.

Surface, which is the top layer of the user experience. The surface is how the product looks to the user.

UCD: User Centered Design
UCD concerns placing users at the center of design decisions. This is not to say that users themselves are producing the final design deliverables, even though users may engage in design activities as participants of design research.

Understand, understand how the user experiences the product or similar products. Truly understanding the end user requires a lot of research

Specify, specify the end user's needs. Based on your research, narrow down which end user's problem is most important to solve.

Design, design solutions to the end user's problem. This is where you develop ideas of what the product might look like and begin to actually build the product.

Evaluate, your design based on the end user's needs. It's important to remember during this process that iteration is key.

The Famous Design Thinking
The design thinking framework is based on the philosophy that a hands-on, user-centric approach to problem solving promotes innovation; in turn, innovation can lead to differentiation and a competitive advantage.

Empathize: Conduct research in order to develop knowledge about what your users do, say, think, and feel.

Define: Combine all your research and observe where your users' problems exist. In pinpointing your users' needs, begin to highlight opportunities for innovation

Ideate: Brainstorm a range of crazy, creative ideas that address the unmet user needs identified in the define phase. Give yourself and your team total freedom; no idea is too farfetched and quantity supersedes quality.

Prototype: Build real, tactile representations for a subset of your ideas. The goal of this phase is to understand what components of your ideas work, and which do not

Test: Return to your users for feedback. Ask yourself 'Does this solution meet users' needs?' and 'Has it improved how they feel, think, or do their tasks?'

Implement: Put the vision into effect. Ensure that your solution is materialized and touches the lives of your end users.

Double Diamond
A visual representation of the design and innovation process. It's a simple way to describe the steps taken in any design and innovation project, irrespective of methods and tools used.

Double Diamond is iterative and non- linear. Each sprint leads the team to new insights that are used to improve the product design. Then the process starts all over again with a new iteration.

Discover - The process starts by questioning the challenge and quickly leads to research to identify user needs.

Define - The second phase is to make sense of the findings, understanding how user needs and the problem align. The result is to create a design brief which clearly defines the challenge based on these insights.

Develop - The third phase concentrates on developing, testing and refining multiple potential solutions.

Deliver - The final phase involves selecting a single solution that works and preparing it for launch

Lean UX
The Lean UX process focuses on reducing wasted time and resources and producing a usable product as quickly as possible. The process is iterative, meaning the team continually updates and revises the product while gathering user research and stakeholder feedback

Think, Research user problems and think about how you might solve them with your design. This step is about gathering research so you have a clear picture of who the product is for and how it will help them

Make, Start designing the product by creating sketches, wireframes, and prototypes. Create a Minimum Viable Product, or MVP, which is a simple prototype of your design that you can test with your target audience. Be prepared to go back and update your prototype as you gather feedback!

Check, Find out how users respond to your design and gather feedback from project stakeholders. Make appropriate adjustments to your designs and repeat the three steps again as needed.

Hook Model
The Hook Model is a way of describing a user's interactions with a product as they pass through four phases: a trigger to begin using the product, an action to satisfy the trigger, a variable reward for the action, and some type of investment that, ultimately, makes the product more valuable to the user. As the user goes through these phases, he builds habits in the process.

Trigger, A trigger to begin using the product. This is the actuator of behavior. It cues the action that then builds a habit. It usually starts with some external triggers like an advertisement or some app notification. By cycling continuously through these hooks, users begin to form associations with internal triggers - that are often emotions

Action, an action to satisfy the trigger. Some specific behavior executed in anticipation of the reward.

Reward, A variable reward for the action. The problem that's solved because of the action that has been performed reinforces the cycle of behavior.

Investment, Some type of investment that, ultimately, makes the product more valuable to the user.

Choose Your Framework

Quick Tip

- Figure out what products you want to craft
- Use most familiar framework with you
- Formulize your productivity
- Be friend with iteration process

Switch In a Midst of Process
You can switch whenever you want, but the question is... does switching framework will put significant change on the result?
